Package: portfolioBacktest
Title: Backtesting of a Portfolio Over Multiple Datasets
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Backtesting of a portfolio in a rolling-window fashion over a 
    dataset of stock prices. Multiple datasets are allowed (e.g., taken 
    randomly over different markets, different time periods, and different
    subset of the stock universe). In addition, multiple portfolios can be
    backtested for a subsequent comparison and ranking on a number of 
    criteria including expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum 
    drawdown, turnover rate, return on investment, computational time, etc.
    The portfolio is defined as a function that takes as input a window of 
    the stock prices and outputs the portfolio weights. This package can be 
    useful for a researcher/practitioner who wants to backtest a set of 
    portfolios over a multitude of datasets over different markets. In 
    addition, it can be particularly useful to evaluate students in a 
    portfolio design course where the grading is based on the performance.
